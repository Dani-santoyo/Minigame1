Hello Professor!
  What you are seeing here is my Final Project in its developmental stages. That being said my game has a functional navigational system directed by user input.
It should be able to pass the Minigame1 assignment criteria. 

  The github for my game contains classes and methods for future systems of my game. For example: The 'Monster' class is never used but will be implemented in 
minigame2 assignment.

  Lastly, I would like to mention that my room descriptions sometimes ask the player to pick up certain items, later versions of my game will allow the player 
to have a functional inventory system but as of right now it is not running properly.
