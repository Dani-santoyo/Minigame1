You walk into a room excited by the idea of potential treasure. Unfortunately, all is not as it seems, there is no
treasure. Instead, glowing red eyes come forward out of the darkness to reveal two monster spiders. Fortunately, you
have your trusty gauntlet on. Your eyes glow white as you bash both spiders into oblivion. You can now continue to
the other end of the room where sitting on a pile of coins is a shiny key. You now have the attic cell key!
You can move SOUTH or UP from here.
